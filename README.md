## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
I started this project by building a function that would pull three random numbers then check if they'd match. Next, were conditionals that returned values based on that match. 3 in a row won the game while anything else lost. With those up I focused on creating statements to update the wallet amount with bets. Finally, I created a function to show the slot images from a sprite based on those random numbers. Throughout the process I used console.log to check if functions were giving the values I expected and work out bugs.

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first time spriting an image, it took a bit to get right and was a highlight moment. I also learned to use the DOM inner text as a value for statements in HTML that could then be returned as a new value. Learning even more about just how many ways the DOM could be manipulated was exciting. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
